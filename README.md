## Description
This is my final project created for CS50x 2020. It is a simple commandline chatbot implemented in the language of python using basic python functions, regular expressions, and random number generator. In short, it tries to parse the input of user word by word and seek for certain words that triggers a pre-programmed response. It can respond to basic interactions like greetings, formalities as well as questions regarding its name, location, the current time, and myriads of other specific questions. For each questions, there is multiple potential output of response, which is depended on a random number being drawn each time. This I hope provides more diversity and inconsistency in the current simplicity state.

Version 0.1 implies that it has certain flaws and weaknesses such as its limited capacity to respond to more personal questions. Due to my currently inability to perform machine learning, I have failed at my first attempt to implement real artificial intelligence into the program. However, I would want update this project for a major upgrade in the near future after learning machine learning with python.

## Usage
